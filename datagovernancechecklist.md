# LLM Data Security Governance Checklist

## 1. Data Security Policies
- [ ] **Access Control**: Define and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Implement data minimization and anonymization practices.
- [ ] **Acceptable Use**: Establish acceptable use policies for LLM applications, including prohibited activities.
- [ ] **Data Lineage**: Maintain a complete data lineage using tools like [Apache Atlas](https://atlas.apache.org/) or [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io/).
- [ ] **Policy Automation**: Use machine-readable policies and tools like [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).

## 2. Accountability and Oversight
- [ ] **Data Stewards**: Appoint stewards responsible for sensitive datasets and governance adherence.
- [ ] **Governance Committee**: Form an AI governance committee with IT, legal, compliance, and business representatives.
- [ ] **Incident Response**: Define roles and protocols for incident response teams.
- [ ] **KPIs**: Measure governance effectiveness with key performance indicators (e.g., compliance rates, response times).
- [ ] **Audit Schedule**: Conduct quarterly governance audits and document results.

## 3. Monitoring and Automation
- [ ] **Real-Time Monitoring**: Deploy tools like [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) or [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/monitor/) to monitor LLM usage.
- [ ] **Audit Trails**: Maintain tamper-proof logs in systems like [Amazon S3 with Object Lock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-lock.html).
- [ ] **Anomaly Detection**: Use AI-based anomaly detection tools to identify unusual LLM interactions.
- [ ] **Compliance Automation**: Automate policy and regulatory updates with platforms like [TrustArc](https://trustarc.com/) or [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/).

## 4. Ethical and Transparent AI Practices
- [ ] **Bias Auditing**: Audit datasets and outputs for bias using [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/) or [Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/).
- [ ] **Explainability**: Deploy frameworks like [SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [LIME](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) for explainability.
- [ ] **Transparency Reports**: Publish regular transparency reports detailing LLM use cases and governance practices.
- [ ] **Stakeholder Grievances**: Establish grievance mechanisms for stakeholders to report concerns.
- [ ] **Ethical Training**: Conduct annual training for employees on ethical AI use.

## 5. Metrics and Continuous Improvement
- [ ] **Governance Metrics**: Track compliance rates, average response times, and transparency scores.
- [ ] **Visualization**: Use tools like [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) or [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) to visualize governance performance.
- [ ] **Quarterly Reviews**: Update policies based on metrics, audits, and stakeholder feedback.
